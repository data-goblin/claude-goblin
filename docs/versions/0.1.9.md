# Version 0.1.9 - Limits Backfilling

Released: October 20, 2025

## Overview

This release adds automatic backfilling for missing limits data in heatmap exports, ensuring continuous visualization without gaps.

## New Features

### Limits Data Backfilling

**Problem:** When limits tracking had gaps (e.g., days where `ccg` wasn't run), the heatmap export would show missing data points, creating visual discontinuities.

```
Day 1: opus=15%, week=30%
Day 2: (missing)
Day 3: (missing)
Day 4: opus=20%, week=35%
```

**Solution:** Missing days are automatically filled with the maximum value from the next earliest available day:

```
Day 1: opus=15%, week=30%
Day 2: opus=15%, week=30%  <- backfilled from Day 1
Day 3: opus=15%, week=30%  <- backfilled from Day 1
Day 4: opus=20%, week=35%
```

This approach is conservative - it assumes limits stayed at or below the last known value until the next measurement.

## Technical Details

The backfilling algorithm:

1. Loads all limits data from the database
2. Identifies gaps between recorded days
3. For each gap, copies the most recent known values forward
4. Only applies to export visualization - database remains unchanged

This ensures:
- Heatmaps show continuous data without jarring gaps
- Historical accuracy is preserved in the database
- Export performance is not significantly impacted

## Upgrading

```bash
pip install --upgrade claude-goblin
```

Re-export your heatmap to see the improved visualization:

```bash
ccg export --show both --open
```
